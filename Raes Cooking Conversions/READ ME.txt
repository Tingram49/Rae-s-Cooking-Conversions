My family and I were cooking dinner one night while talking about ideas for a program that might be useful. While talking about it, we got interrupted with the question of “How many Tablespoons are in a cup?” and from there, the idea was born. An application that can take any cooking measurement and give you the equivalent conversions for other units, Cups, Tsp, Tbsp, Fl Oz, ML. It will also convert recipes serving portions as well.

• The name of the GUI application.

Rae’s Cooking Conversions
• What is the purpose of the Application?

To easily convert one cooking measurement into other formats.
Receive a receipt from user and the number of servings it provides, then converts the recipe for another desired number of users.
• List the reason you are creating the Application.

To save time and remove guess work when needing to change one measurement to another.
• What do you want the Application to accomplish? List the goals you have for the Application.

A simple and direct application that is easy to use without the need of any instructions.
• Who is your target audience? Describe your target audience by age, gender, socioeconomic characteristics, and so on.

The target audience can be anyone old enough to cook. Anyone with access to a computing device (Cell phone, tablet, computer). Genderless, ageless, any economic situation.
